# Minimal react typescript webpack

Hi! In this project I created a minimal setup for a react project with typescript.

## Features

- React 19
- Typescript 5
- Webpack 5
- Hot module replacement
- Clean webpack plugin 4

## Installation

- go to project root: ```cd inbank/front-end```
- install dependencies: ```npm install```

---

# Running the project

Now we can run the project, so we only need run this command:

```
$ npm run start
```
